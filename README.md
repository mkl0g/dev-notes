# 📘 Dev Notes

> Inspired by @jbranchaud's [repo](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til), @thoughtbot's [repo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til) and @charliegerard's [repo](https://github.com/charliegerard/dev-notes)

This repository is collection of notes about things which I learn. Languages, frameworks, concepts, etc. It is not a public wiki which tries to help study to everyone. It's just my work dev notes, simple examples and code snippets.
